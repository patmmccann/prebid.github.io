about:
- In Prebid 6.0, support for legacy browsers is no longer assured.
- Publishers may conditionally deploy the 5.x branch and add polyfills
- One strategy to do this is simply the module/nomodule approach discussed here https://philipwalton.com/articles/deploying-es2015-code-in-production-today/
- Another strategy is to conditionally serve one file or another based on instructions to your cdn
